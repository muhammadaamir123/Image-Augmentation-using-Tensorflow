# Image-Augmentation-using-Tensorflow

Data Augmentation is a technique used to expand or enlarge your dataset by using the existing data of the dataset. We apply different techniques to expand our dataset so that it will help to train our model better with a large dataset. If you are having a small dataset and if you use that dataset to train your model and overfit the data. So to increase the ability and performance of your model, or to generalize our model we need a proper dataset so that we can train our model. Data Augmentation helps you to achieve this.
Image Augmentation is one of the technique we can apply on an image dataset to expand our dataset so that no overfitting occurs and our model generalizes well.
So, If you have relatively small dataset then go with this technique to expand your dataset to generalize your model.
Hope you got the idea, why we do data augmentation. We will be exploring some of the techniques and implement them with TensorFlow, which will be pretty easy.

# Image Augmentation Techniques and Implementation
  - Rotation
  - Width Shifting
  - Height Shifting
  - Brightness
  - Shear Intensity
  - Zoom
  - Channel Shift
  - Horizontal Flip
  - Vertical Flip

# How to use this code
Just change `image_path` according to your path
